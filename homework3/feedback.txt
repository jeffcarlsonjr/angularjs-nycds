Looking good Jeff.  Some points on simplification below.

- The average/grade/pass need to be calculated each time an assignment is added.  So rather than call it from the controller I would call it from the add/remove assignment funcions.

	eg:

		Grades.prototype.addAss = function(name,grade){
			this.assignment.push({name: name, grade: grade})
			this.calcStats();
		}

		Grades.prototype.calcStats = function(){
			this.average = Help_Grader.gradeSum(this.assignment);
			this.letterGrade = Help_Grader.gradeLetter(this.average);
			this.pass = Help_Grader.passFail(this.grade)
		}

Other than that I don't have much.  Great Job!
