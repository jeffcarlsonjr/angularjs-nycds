Great Job Jeff, The main purpose of this assignment is to utilize radio buttons and ng-class and from what I see you are getting it perfectly.

Everything is working great, but here are some optimazations you could make:


1)  Put the themes into an array and use ng-repeat to display the radio buttons instead of making all the radio buttons manually.

2)  Utilize child css selectors.  Here you are using a model object "changeColor" to set different classes on all the elements you want updated.  An alternative approach is to use only one ng-class on the parent element and use css child selectors to style everything else.

Take a look at the solutions I put in your repository to see this in action.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Great Job!
