I think we went over a few things in class, but here's what I have for this assignment.

- Those genre definitions should be moved out of the controller.
- You shouldn't need to have booleans to indicate what should be showed, angular should just update the view whenever a new genre is selected.  You can do this with radio buttons, but if you want to use links you can use and ng-click and set a single value let's call it "selectedGenre".  To do this it will make things easier to move the genres into an array and just ng-repeat over them.  Take a look at the solutions and let me know if you have any questions.

- on setting the checkbox you should just be able to use the "song" object

	eg: instead of MCtrl.rap.songs.name[$index]

		<ul style="list-style: none">
	    	 <li ng-repeat="song in MCtrl.rap.songs">
	    	 <input type="checkbox" ng-model="MCtrl.rap.songs.name[$index]"/>
	    	 {{song.name}}
	    	 </li>
		</ul>

	you can just say:

		<ul style="list-style: none">
	    	 <li ng-repeat="song in MCtrl.rap.songs">
	    	 <input type="checkbox" ng-model="song.isChecked"/>
	    	 {{song.name}}
	    	 </li>
		</ul>

The submit button wasn't working for me.
